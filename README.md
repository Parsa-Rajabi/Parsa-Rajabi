### Welcome! 👋🏽

Hi, I'm Parsa! I am currently a Master's student at Simon Fraser University with an interest in <strong>Computer Science Education</strong>, Computational Thinking within K-12 Education and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).

During my spare time, I love to cook, travel, hike and volunteer in the community / on campus!
